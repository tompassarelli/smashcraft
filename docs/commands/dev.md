# Dev

- Every save: leave `bun wisp dev` running. It prints the saved files' type
  errors, the affected unit tests, the journeys (the quick match in two
  simulated clients and the affected journey tests) and the whole check, each
  timed from the save; add `--data A --data B` to also hot-reload both
  clients as `hot --watch` does. smashcraft:ts/scripts/wisp/commands/dev.ts
  declares the files tests read at run time, the journey tests and the
  per-file source-shape audit.

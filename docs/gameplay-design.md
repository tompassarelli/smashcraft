## Stale moves and freshness bonuses

Smashcraft deliberately has neither stale-move penalties nor freshness bonuses.
Repeating a move does not reduce its damage or knockback parameters, and using
a different move does not grant a damage bonus.

Attack-history penalties add inconsistency without improving the intended
combat decisions. Repetitive play should be punishable through startup and
recovery, spacing, commitment, defensive options, and opponent counterplay. If
a move is too effective when repeated, improve those interactions instead of
adding a hidden repetition penalty. Move outcomes should remain predictable
under the same combat conditions; victim percent, weight, hit region, and
other explicit mechanics still affect the result.

This is an intentional departure from Melee, not a missing feature.

Owner decision reaffirmed 2026-10-04: **skip Melee's stale-move mechanic**,
including its freshness bonus, for the physics foundation and subsequent
character balancing. Do not implement a recent-move queue, history-based damage
or knockback multipliers, or projectile staleness snapshots. This omission is
accepted scope, not a fidelity defect or a deferred implementation task.
Independent Melee comparisons must state that this modifier is omitted; all
other shared formula requirements remain open until verified.

# Authored fighter animation work

Required initial clips from the owner: jab; forward tilt; up-angled forward
tilt; down-angled forward tilt; jump; double jump; forward roll; backward roll;
get-up attack. Blender 5.1.1 is installed and background startup passed. No custom clips
have been authored or exported yet.

Preserve editable Blender scenes and exported Warcraft model assets. Author
on a rig compatible with the selected Warcraft fighters; do not claim that a
clip from another skeleton can be dropped onto Archer/Rifleman unchanged.
Keep gameplay displacement and collision in simulation; animation follows
logical move timing for anticipation, contact, recovery and invulnerability.

## Candidate tool boundary

Both are candidate Blender MDL import/export add-ons. The second still declares
Blender 2.80 in its metadata, so its name does not establish compatibility with
the installed Blender. README documents sequence ranges through paired timeline
markers, reference pose at frame zero, and limitations on classic MDL skinning.
The second add-on registers successfully in Blender 5.1.1, but animated export
fails: its animation reader accesses `Action.fcurves`, removed by Blender's
layered-action API. The executable counterexample is preserved at
~/code/wc3-melee/worktrees/test-loop/build/animation-probe/export.py.
Repair the animation reader in an owned tool checkout before authoring clips;
registration alone does not validate export. Actual import → edit → export →
in-game playback remains the deciding check before choosing the pipeline.

The add-ons are GPL tools (repository license GPL-3.0; individual source headers
also contain GPL-2.0-or-later notices). They remain standalone local tools,
not code incorporated into Wurst gameplay. Preserve their notices and license
when modifying/distributing tools; do not copy tool code into the game.

The existing local animation-library archive is
~/code/game-assets/quaternius/Universal Animation Library[Standard].zip.
Its listing contains FBX and GLB variants plus License.txt, but rig/clip contents
have not been inspected. It may help with motion reference/retargeting after
skeleton compatibility is established; Warcraft fighters remain the requested
art direction. No assets have been copied from the archive into the map.
